Welcome to the Voll Med Clinic Management System, a Java Spring Boot project that empowers you to manage your medical clinic seamlessly. Here, you can track and organize your medical professionals, patients, and appointment scheduling efficiently. Let's dive into the details!

## Project Features

- **Tech Stack**:
    - Java 17
    - Spring Boot 3
    - Lombok for streamlined code
    - MySQL with Flyway for database management
    - JPA/Hibernate for robust data persistence
    - Maven for dependency management and building
    - Postman for API testing
    - JWT Tokens for secure authentication and authorization
    - JUnit and Mockito for unit testing
    - SpringDoc for comprehensive API documentation

- **Description**:
    - This project primarily focuses on developing a robust RESTful API for Voll Med, our fictitious medical clinic.
    - It allows you to manage doctors, patients, appointment scheduling, and other clinic-related tasks.

- **Persistence Layer**:
    - The application's data persistence is implemented using Java Persistence API (JPA) with Hibernate as its JPA provider.

- **User Interface**:
    - Please note that this project is backend-centric, focusing solely on the RESTful API. It does not include graphical interfaces such as HTML pages or a mobile application.

## Getting Started

- **Prerequisites**:
    - Ensure you have Java 17 installed in your environment.
    - Set up a MySQL database and apply database migrations using Flyway.
    - Utilize Maven for project dependency management.

- **API Documentation**:
    - Access the API documentation using SpringDoc. Explore the documentation to understand the available endpoints and how to use them effectively.

## Configuration

- **Authentication and Authorization**:
    - The system leverages JWT Tokens for user authentication and authorization. Configure the necessary keys and security policies.

- **Database Migrations**:
    - Employ Flyway for applying database migrations. Ensure that your database is correctly configured.

## Testing

- This project includes unit tests with JUnit and Mockito. Execute the tests to guarantee the proper functioning of the application.
